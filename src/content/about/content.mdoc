I started programming at 8 years old, making shapes and patterns in [**Logo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_\(programming_language\)) on my mom's Compaq Deskpro.

At 15, I watched [**Pirates of Silicon Valley**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley) and [**Triumph of the Nerds**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Nerds) at a friend's place. Stories of hackers building world-changing companies stuck with me.

Now I live in Gurgaon with my dog [**Greg**](https://instagram.com/thegoldenboy_greg) and my wife Garima. I run [**Hetu Labs**](https://hetu-labs.com), a tech consultancy, and I'm building [**Stream**](https://stream.arjunverma.in), a supply chain tool for garment manufacturers.

I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember. I wrote my first program when I was 8 years old, creating all sorts of shapes and patterns in&nbsp;[**Logo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_\(programming_language\)) on my mom’s old Compaq Deskpro. It was more than a pastime; it was a portal to a world of endless possibilities.

My journey wasn’t initially steered towards entrepreneurship. I guess the seed of entrepreneurship was planted in my mind, at the age of 15, while watching &nbsp;[**Pirates of Silicon Valley**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley) &&nbsp;[**Triumph of the Nerds**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Nerds), at a friend’s house. The inspiring stories of simple hackers transforming the world with nothing but a laptop had a profound impact on me.

Today, I live in Gurgaon with my dogo, &nbsp;[**Greg**](https://instagram.com/thegoldenboy_greg), and Garima, (my partner of seven years who has now become my wife). I’m still pursuing my lifelong dream:&nbsp;**to create value that transcends the ordinary**. And with every step, I continue to carry the spirit of that 8-year-old who saw a world of possibilities in every pixel and line of code.

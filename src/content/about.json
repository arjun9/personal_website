Stories of hackers building world-changing companies stuck with me.\n\nNow I live in Gurgaon with my dog [Greg](https://instagram.com/thegoldenboy_greg) and my wife Garima. I run [Hetu Labs](https://hetu-labs.com), a tech consultancy, and I'm building [Stream](https://stream.arjunverma.in), a supply chain tool for garment manufacturers.",

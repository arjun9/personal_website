  "content": "I've loved making things for as long as I can remember. I wrote my first program when I was 8 years old, creating all sorts of shapes and patterns in [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) on my mom's old Compaq Deskpro. It was more than a pastime; it was a portal to a world of endless possibilities.\n\nMy journey wasn't initially steered towards entrepreneurship. I guess the seed of entrepreneurship was planted in my mind, at the age of 15, while watching [Pirates of Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley) & [Triumph of the Nerds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Nerds), at a friend's house. The inspiring stories of simple hackers transforming the world with nothing but a laptop had a profound impact on me.\n\nToday, I live in Gurgaon with my dogo, [Greg](https://instagram.com/thegoldenboy_greg), and Garima, (my partner of seven years who has now become my wife). I'm still pursuing my lifelong dream: **to create value that transcends the ordinary**. And with every step, I continue to carry the spirit of that 8-year-old who saw a world of possibilities in every pixel and line of code.",
